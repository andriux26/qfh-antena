  <a href="http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/img/g3lmo/002.jpeg"><img src="http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/icon/g3lmo/002.jpeg" title="Nev's stealth QFH" align=left border=0></a>
The QFH consists of two loops. To obtain a circular polarization,
    it is necessary that the currents in both loops have a phase difference
    of 90 degrees. Though it is possible to make the phase difference
    with a phasing line (which is popular with the turnstile antenna),
    the most popular solution for the QFH is to use different loop sizes.
    This causes the current to be inductive in one, and capacitive in the
    other.
    <p>
    Though the currents in both loops are reactive, connecting them in
    parallel causes the feedpoint, at the top, to be at nearly 50 Ohm, 
    resistive.
    <p>
    The only problem remaining, is that the feedpoint, as with most antennas,
    is symmetrical. This means we shouldn't connect a coax cable (asymmetric)
    at this point. Though the antenna will be adapted, currents on the
    outside of the cable will offset the radiation pattern of the antenna.
    <p>
    Several solutions exist:
    <ul>
     <li><b>Transformer</b>
       We could install a balun transformer at the top, but simple baluns
       transform impedance too - we want to maintain 50 Ohms.
     <li><b>Choke</b>  
       Applying a couple of turns to the coax cable at the top will make
       the braid act as an RFC choke and block outside currents.
     <li><b>Infinite balun</b>
       Feeding the cable through one of the loop sides, will form an
       'infinite balun'.
     <li><b>Preamplifier</b>
       Another - elegant - solution would be to install a preamplifier at
       the top, and design it for symmetrical input. As far as I know,
       none are on the market, so we'd have to make our own...
    </ul>
    Finally, using simply two loops, without the strange 'twist' which is
    so typical of the QFH, would generate a much more directional (vertical)
    radiation pattern. Also, the polarization would turn to linear near the
    horizon.
    <p>
    The 'twist' generates the desired hemispherical pattern, which 
    permits us to hear from horizon to horizon.

    A simple solution for eliminating the exterior cable currents, is
    to wind the cable a number of times around the vertical support,
    making the outside act as an RF coke (inductor).
    <p>
    The diameter should be as small as is practical, to reduce radiation
    as much as possible. The number of turns depends on the diameter,
    of course, but the inductance should be large enough (compared to
    50 Ohm) to reduce the outside currents.
    <p>
    The windings should be as near to the top as possible, to reduce
    the length of the radiating parts.

<i>Infinite balun</i>
    </td>
    <td valign=top>
    Many questions arise about the infinite baluns...
    <p>
    The impedance at the top is the one we want at the bottom too. So
    we cannot tolerate impedance transformation through the balun. This
    means we <i>have</i> to use a cable with the same impedance - else
    there would be a transformation!
    <p>
    For UHF and SHF work, the most practical solution is probably to use
    coax cable for the actual antenna itself. For lower frequencies, we
    should use tubing, and feed a 50 Ohm cable through it.
    <p>
    Part of the infinite balun principle, the cable's braid should be
    connected to the antenna at the bottom center. In practice I have not
    been able to detect much difference.
