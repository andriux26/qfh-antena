    The quadrifilar helicoidal antenna - quite a mouthful - is easy to
      construct (even though it does look complicated), and the results are 
      excellent. In contrast with the omnipresent turnstile antenna (two 
      crossed dipoles with a reflector) the circularity is almost perfect 
      in any direction. I've also received quite a few reports from people
      who built the antenna using the data from this page, who were very
      satisfied.
      <p>
      In it's original form, the relation between diameter and height is
      0.44, but decreasing this relation slightly, a still better coverage
      of for satellites near the horizon is obtained. In literature and
      on the web, extreme versions can be found.
      <p>
      If the left column of this page (under 'Pictures') are links to
      pictures of several versions built by me and sent to me by several
      happy readers. The first link shows images generated by POV-ray.

  <h2 class="section">  On using the QFH for WiFi</h2>
  
    Regularly I get questions similar to the one which follows: <p><div style="border: solid #333333 1px; padding: 4px; margin-top: 2px">
<tt>
    Hi, your page is very interesting. I'm interested in an omnidirectional
    antena with circular polarization on 2.4 GHz, but I'm not sure if you
    have seen any successful tests using the QFH for 2.4 GHz. According to
    the calculator, I get an antenna which is slightly over 4.8 cm in height.
    Could you tell me the gain which would have this antenna? Would it be
    useful for a hot spot?</tt></div>
  <p>
    Alfred... There is no such thing as gain in an antenna. This is one of
    the most difficult things to teach my students. This term was established
    many years ago, probably for commercial reasons...
    <p>
    The correct term is directivity - i.e., the capacity of antenna to
    direct the available power into one preferred direction. This looks
    as a gain in the correct direction, but the power was 'stolen' from
    elsewhere.
    <p>
    The QFH is an excellent antenna for satellites, as it receives from 
    'the entire northen hemisphere', from horizon to horizon, with all the
    sky in between. Such an antenna cannot have any significant 'gain', as
    it doesn't have directivity. Such an antenna is not useful for hot spots,
    as you probably won't have any clients 'in the sky'.
    <p>
    Moreover, your clients, except if you give them new, circularly polarizaed
    antennas, will probably be using vertical antennas from their laptops or
    notebooks. This means an extra loss of 3 dB because of the polarization.
    <p>
    I'll put this text on the page, as it seems to be a regular issue.
    <p>
